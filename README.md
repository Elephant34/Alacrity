# Alacrity
## Version: 0.0
 Alacrity- _Cheerful readiness_

 This is a simple productivity tracker/to do list app created with [godot](godotengine.org/). I am purly making this for myself but feel free to use and edit however you like

 ### Version 0.1 goals
 - [ ] A set of timers to track what I am doing
   - [ ] _Optional_: Make the timers customisable per user (bonus of not exposing my procrastination methods to all of github :wink:)
 - [ ] A system to show the ratio of the timers per day and track progress
 - [ ] A save system of the timers so the data is persisstent even when the computer is closed

### Version future.x goals
 - [ ] Add Pomodoro timings to be built in
 - [ ] Add toggle so code knows which timers are productive vs procrastination
 - [ ] Some kind of reward system for a healthy balence of productive:procrastinaiton
 - [ ] Add target times for each timer (e.g. want to read for 45mins a day)
 - [ ] Complete optional goals in other versions unless they decide to be scrapped
 - [ ] Added a todo list board and reminders (proberly aimed at a much higher version number >1.0)
